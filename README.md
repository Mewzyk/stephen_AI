# UCSC AI Sandbox
General purpose project whose purpose is to practice the implementation of knowldage gained while studying Computer Science at UCSC. Initial work has been done to implement a framework for generating graphs. Future work will involve implementing graph search AI alrogithms and visualizting these algorithms using D3.js

## Getting Started

The project is very bare bones at the moment. With time there will be more instructions for startup but for now just git cone this repository and checkout the code I've written
### Prerequisites

python 3.5.x

## Progress
* Basic Graph Framework in stephen_graph
* Depth first search in stephen_dfs
* Main program builds an example graph and runs an instance of DFS
