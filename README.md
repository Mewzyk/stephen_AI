# UCSC AI Sandbox
General purpose project to practice implementation of knowldage gained while studying Computer Science at UCSC. Initial work has been done to implement a framework for generating graphs. Future work will involve implementation and visualization of graph search AI algorithms.

## Getting Started (TO DO)

The project is very bare bones at the moment. With time there will be more instructions for startup but for now just git cone this repository and checkout the code I've written

### Prerequisites

python 3.5.x

## Progress

* Basic Graph Framework in stephen_graph
* Depth first search in stephen_dfs
* Main program builds an example graph and runs an instance of DFS

## TO DO

* Getting started section with code snippets
* Driver function that contains interactive functionality
* Implement BFS
* Implement Shortest Path
* Add edge weight functionality
* Implement Greedy search
* Example Dataset (possibly cities/distances)
* Graph visualization in d3.js
