# UCSC AI Sandbox
General purpose project to practice implementation of knowldege gained while studying Computer Science at UCSC. Initial work has been done to implement a framework for generating graphs. Future work will involve implementation and visualization of graph search AI algorithms.

## Getting Started (TO DO)

This project contains some independent work related to graph theory and path traversal. Inside of each P* directory is a solution to a different portion of the berkley A.I. project.

### Prerequisites

python 3.5.x

## Progress

* Basic Graph Framework in stephen_graph
* Depth first search in stephen_dfs
* Bread first search in bre_bfs
* Main program builds an example graph and runs an instance of BFS
* Graph visualization implemented by example D3.js project (Mike Bostock)
* Got example dataset (actors/actresses in Le Mis)

## TO DO

* Draw breakdown of classes used
* Getting started section with code snippets
* Driver function that contains interactive functionality
* Implement Shortest Path
* Add edge weight functionality
* Implement Greedy search
