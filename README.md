# UCSC AI Sandbox
General purpose project to practice implementation of knowldege gained while studying Computer Science at UCSC. Initial work has been done to implement a framework for generating graphs. Future work will involve implementation and visualization of graph search AI algorithms.

## Getting Started (TO DO)

The project is very bare bones at the moment. With time there will be more instructions for startup but for now just git cone this repository and checkout the code I've written

### Prerequisites

python 3.5.x

## Progress

* Basic Graph Framework in stephen_graph
* Depth first search in stephen_dfs
* Bread first search in bre_bfs
* Main program builds an example graph and runs an instance of BFS
* Graph visualization implemented by example D3.js project (Mike Bostock)
* Got example dataset (actors/actresses in Le Mis)

## TO DO

* Draw breakdown of classes used
* Getting started section with code snippets
* Driver function that contains interactive functionality
* Implement Shortest Path
* Add edge weight functionality
* Implement Greedy search
